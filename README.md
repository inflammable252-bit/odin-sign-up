# Sign-up Form
Sign up form for Odin Virtual Reality Tours, a fictional company. This is a practice project done as part of the Odin Project curriculum.

While the focus of the project was to create a form, this page also serves as a personal exploration into responsive layouts and different CSS techniques. This primarily includes:
-Media queries
-Dynamic units
-Custom fonts
-CSS nesting
-Pseudo-classes

## Future considerations:
-Better pre-planning with Flexbox (and later, Grid) to avoid over-adjusting margin/padding/gaps for layout responsiveness.
-Cleaner conventions for nesting vs selectors.
-Planning for media queries in CSS (i.e. place after selectors, or make new section?).
-Establish repeated styling properties earlier and create variables.
